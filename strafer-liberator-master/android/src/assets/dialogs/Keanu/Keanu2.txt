I see you still have your trusty laser!
#
Lucky for you, these lands are 
unforgiving.
Your other items? 
#
The crash scattered them
Your space costume HUD inventory
displays all your lost items
#
No worries, it shouldn’t be a problem
you just can’t use them(naturally:>).
#
...
#
If I think better
I think I saw your sword in the forest
open your map and go get it
#
I will wait at the big stone
But take care 
there are goblins around
#
PS they drop pills sometimes
